# time-series

Addition of Time Series Forecast notebook: Uses Jena Climate Dataset to predict temperature using the time series variable (temperature), using an LSTM network and achieving high R2 score of 0.98 on testing dataset. The code uses PyTorch for model creation, training and evaluation.

Addition of Multivariate Time Series Forecast notebook: Uses Jena Climate Dataset to predict temperature and pressure using the time series variables such as temperature, and sin and cos signals for time series variables, using GRU, LSTM, and CNN networks. The code uses PyTorch for model creation, training and evaluation.
